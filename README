Sampler: dataset reduction utility for phylogenetic analyses

Sampler takes a multi-FASTA (not an alignment!) or a PHYLIP-formatted
distance matrix and samples a requested number of sequences from it,
trying to be as taxonomically comprehensive as possible. If a FASTA file
is supplied, the distances are calculated by Scoredist metric.
Returns a reduced matrix or FASTA file, depending on what was supplied

Options:
-f Multi-FASTA file
-d PHYLIP-formatted square distance matrix
-n Number or percentage of sequences to sample

Temporary note: set NWALIGN variable to the location of the Fortran
aligner. In some release I'll throw it into distribution.
