Sampler: dataset reduction utility for phylogenetic analyses

Sampler takes a multi-FASTA (not an alignment!) or an EMBOSS-formatted
distance matrix and samples a requested number of sequences from it,
trying to be as taxonomically comprehensive as possible. If a FASTA file
is supplied, the distances are calculated by Scoredist metric.
Returns a reduced matrix or FASTA file, depending on what was supplied

Options:
-f Multi-FASTA file
-d PHYLIP-formatted square distance matrix
-n Number or percentage of sequences to sample
-p FASTA contains aminoacid sequences. Defaults to True
-i Print only IDs of selected sequences

Dependencies:
Python 3.4 or higher
Biopython

Temporary note: set NWALIGN variable in reductor.py to the location of the Fortran
aligner. In some later release I'll throw it into distribution.
