Sampler: dataset reduction utility for phylogenetic analyses

Sampler takes a multi-FASTA (not an alignment!) or an EMBOSS-formatted
distance matrix and samples a requested number of sequences from it,
trying to be as taxonomically comprehensive as possible. If a FASTA file
is supplied, the distances are calculated by Scoredist metric.
Returns a reduced distance matrix and, if possible, reduced FASTA file.

Options:
-f Multi-FASTA file
-d PHYLIP-formatted square distance matrix
-n Number or percentage of sequences to sample
-p FASTA contains aminoacid sequences. Defaults to True
-i Print only IDs of selected sequences

Dependencies:
Python 3.4 or higher
Biopython
EMBOSS 6.6.0.0

Installation notes:

Make sure EMBOSS needle is available in your $PATH. If it is not
possible (but you do have EMBOSS installed), add EMBOSS/bin directory
path to the NEEDLE_CALL variable in reductor.py
